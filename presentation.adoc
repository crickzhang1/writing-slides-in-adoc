== Why Asciidoctor-Revealjs

[%step]
* Writing in simple `adoc` syntax (https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Ref, window="_blank"]) as my daily notes/articles.
** Easily convert my notes to presentation. :)
* Combined power of _revealjs_ for many presentating convenience.
* Convertable to `.html`, viewable everywhere there is a https://browsehappy.com[modern^] browser.
** Thanks to _revealjs_, the result is slides in `html`, compatible on every device.

== First Glance

* Two level of structure. [_If there are more, re-think if it's overstaffed? :)_]
** `==` for first level sections (_horizontal navigatable_: LEFT/RIGHT direction keys)
** `===` for subsections (_vertial navigatable_: UP/DOWN direction keys)
* What you can write in Asciidoctor, you can write in slides.

=== Subsections Shown Vertically

Subsections may be navigated with UP/DOWN keys.
